# Oto Express Mongo TypeScript Boilerplate

This boilerplate provides a foundational setup for an Express application interfacing with MongoDB, all written in TypeScript.

```

## Running the Project

### 1. Start MongoDB using Docker Compose

To streamline the process, we've included a `docker-compose.yml` file that allows you to spin up a MongoDB instance without having it installed on your machine.

To start MongoDB, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start MongoDB on port `27017`. No authentication is required for this development instance.

### 2. Install Dependencies and Run the Server

First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you can start the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will boot up on port `3000` (or whichever port you've set in your environment variables).
